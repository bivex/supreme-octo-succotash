-c, --collect=<string>        Run the specified analysis and collect data. Tip:
                              Specify the search-dir when collecting data.


Usage: advisor --collect=<string> [--action-option] [--global-option] [[--]
        <target> [<target options>]]

        <string> is one of the following analysis types:

            survey        - Discover where efficient vectorization and/or threading pays off the most.
            dcfg          - Analyze data control flow graph.
            dependencies  - Identify and explore loop-carried dependencies for marked loops.
            map           - Identify and explore complex memory accesses for marked loops.
            offload       - Run Offload Modeling perspective analyses with a single command.
            projection    - Project performance on a target device.
            roofline      - Run the Survey analysis immediately followed by the Trip Counts & FLOP analysis to visualize actual performance against hardware-imposed performance ceilings.
            suitability   - Check predicted parallel performance in an annotated <target>.
            tripcounts    - Identify the number of loop iterations.

Action Options:

--app-working-dir=<string>    Specify a directory where the application will be
                              run.
--assume-dependencies (default) | --no-assume-dependencies
                              Assume that a loop has dependencies if the loop
                              dependency type is unknown.
--assume-hide-taxes | --no-assume-hide-taxes (default)
                              Use an optimistic approach to estimate invocation
                              taxes: assume the invocation tax is "hidden"
                              and/or paid only for the first kernel launch.
                              Important: Enable this option to analyze oneAPI
                              (DPC++ or OpenMP target) applications running on
                              CPU.
--assume-ndim-dependency (default) | --no-assume-ndim-dependency
                              When searching for an optimal N-dimensional
                              offload, assume there are dependencies between
                              inner and outer loops.
--assume-single-data-transfer | --no-assume-single-data-transfer (default)
                              Use an optimistic approach to estimate data
                              transfer taxes: assume data is only transferred
                              once for each offload, and all instances share
                              that data (default).
                              Use a pessimistic approach to estimate data
                              transfer taxes: assume each data object is
                              transferred for every instance of an offload that
                              uses it. This method assumes no data re-use
                              between calls to the same kernel. JIT-compiled
                              loops (DPC++, OpenMP Target, or OpenCL CPU device
                              code) are still counted only once because the
                              call count for those loops is usually inflated.
--auto-finalize (default) | --no-auto-finalize
                              Finalize Survey and Trip Counts & FLOP analysis
                              data after collection is complete.
                              Tip: Disabling can temporarily minimize overhead
                              when you plan to view collected data on a
                              different machine.
--auto-finalize (default) | --no-auto-finalize
--batching | --no-batching (default)
                              Enable job batching for a top-level offload.
                              Emulate the execution of more than one instance
                              simultaneously. This option is equivalent to
                              --threads=total_EU_count*threads_per_EU.
--benchmarks-sync (default) | --no-benchmarks-sync
                              Run benchmarks on only one concurrently executing
                              Intel Advisor instance to avoid concurrency
                              issues with regard to platform limits.
                              Tip: Use to generate accurate Roofline analysis
                              results for MPI targets.

                              acheline_size]/[num_of_level3_caches]:[num_of_way
                              s_level3_connected]:[level3_cache_size]:[level3_c
                              acheline_size]
                              Example:

                              m:64l
                              For multiple-device cache simulation:
                              Specify device configurations. If not specified,
                              cache configuration for all supported devices is
                              used.
                              Usage:
                              --cache-config=[level1_cache1_size][level2_cache1
                              _size][level3_cache1_size]/[level1_cache2_size][l
                              evel2_cache2_size][level3_cache2_size]
                              Example: --cache-config=32k:256k:6m/64k:512k:256m

                              uncovered latency.
                              first - Assume only the first SEND instruction in

                              was collected on. Divide all original CPU times
                              by the cpu_scale_factor.
--custom-config=<string>      Specify a configuration file by its absolute path

                              allowed in the option entry; use a new line
                              instead.
                              Caution: Arguments specified in an option file
                              are processed before any arguments specified on
                              the command line; therefore, options specified on
                              the command line can override options in the
                              option file. If multiple option files are used,
                              they are processed in the order in which they are
                              specified on the command line.

--set-dependency=<string>     Assume loops have a dependency if they have IDs
                              or source locations from a specified
                              comma-separated list. If the list is empty,
                              assume all loops have a dependency. Note:
                              --set-dependency option takes precendence over
                              --set-parallel, so if the loop is listed in both,
                              it will be considered as having a dependency.

                              parallel. Note: --set-dependency option takes
                              precendence over --set-parallel, so if the loop
                              is listed in both, it will be considered as
